    <h2>More About Movies</h2>
    <p class="movieParagraph">
      I absolutely <b>LOVE</b> to watch movies. Watching movies with
      friends/family is almost an unbeatable experience and is always
      entertaining for me. All of the movies that I put in my list above are
      truly special to me, and some of them I have watched multiple times. If
      you are reading this and haven't seen one of them, I definitely reccomend
      that you give it a watch, since many of them are very famous classics! My
      favorite actor is Leonardo DiCaprio. I love all of his movies (especially
      Inception and Shutter Island) and whenever he is in the cast I know the
      movie will be entertaining. Finally, my favorite movie genre is Science
      Fiction. I find this genre both fascinating and exciting, since the
      setting and story is often very creative.
