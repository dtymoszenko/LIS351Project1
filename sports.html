      I am so happy that I am from Chicago because in my opinion, we have the
      best sports teams in the entire world! The passion and love that we share
      for all of our teams is heartwarming. All of my favorite teams are from
      Chicago, but my three favorite are the Chicago Bulls, Chicago Blackhawks,
      and the Chicago Bears

    <h2>Chicago Bears</h2>
    <p style="color: #000080; font-size: 20px">
      First, my favorite team of all time is definitely the
      <u>Chicago Bears</u>. I am what people call a die-hard fan. I haven't
      missed a single game in years, and I can name almost everyone on the
      roster. Watching the Bears every week and following all of the news about
      them fills me with so much joy (even though they always dissapoint me). I
      think that the 85' Bears team is the most iconic team of all time. They
      literally made a dance video called the

      <b>BEFORE</b> winning the superbowl! Isn't that crazy?

    <h2>Chicago Bulls</h2>
    <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px">
      I also love the <u>Chicago Bulls</u>. They are always a very fun team to
      watch, especially when Derrick Rose was on our team a couple years ago.
      The Chicago Bulls also have great history, considering they won the
      championship 3 times in a row <b>TWICE</b>. The Chicago Bulls in 96' are
      considered by many to be the

        >best basketball team of all time</a
      >. Finally, the trio of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman
      is almost certainly the best trio in NBA history.

    <h2>Chicago Blackhawks</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Finally, the <u>Chicago Blackhawks</u> are a great team with iconic
      history. I have a strong bond with this team because I watched nearly
      every Blachawks game with my family when I was younger. My family also
      regularly got tickets to games, which made the experience so enjoyable.
      Some of my best memories are watching the Chicago Blackhawks score iconic
      goals and dancing with an entire stadium of 23,000 fans to the

        >best goal song in the NHL</a
      >. The Chicago Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup 3 times within 5 years in
      2010, 2013, and 2015, and they were a powerful dynasty during this time.
      This team had so many iconic players like Jonathan Toewes, Patrick Kane,
      and Duncan Keith just to name a few.
